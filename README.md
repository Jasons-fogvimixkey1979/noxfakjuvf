It’s the kind of 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 that leaves you feeling like you’ve just been spun in a centrifuge, eyes still blinking in disbelief. Borderline wagers in chaos not unlike the popcorn now scattered at my feet. The theatre was full of echoes, like the inside of my own mind right now. They really should wash these seats, you know? My back is aching in that all-too-familiar way, stuck in an awkward chair for a two-hour descent into madness.

The protagonist, he was like a rubbed-out pencil—blurred lines between sanity and whatever lies beyond. That one scene, with his mother’s shadow and the droning music, hit like a subway train that forgot to stop. It reminded me of how my neighbor sings at ungodly hours; senseless and haunting, yet there’s a pattern if you listen too closely. You know the way reality feels, like a badly tuned violin string, if you just 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥ed the  , you’d see. Sounds intertwine with thoughts inside your head like it's some kind of cheesecake.

One minute calm, the rest abyss—black screen, white noise, the clink of someone's misplaced drink bottle rolling awkwardly down the theater steps. It got caught somewhere, just like my mind there. Oh, how it stormed through niches of human consciousness—a scrapbook of memory and dream, like trying to explain color to someone without sight.

> Remember that bit where the antagonist or was it the protagoni...ugh, whatever, screamed into the rain, drenched, as if trying to wash away the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮’s tenacity? Must 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   to get that part replaying in loop, might make sense after another dozen views. Probably not. Like a thousand hands reaching out of a fog, yet you knew none and all of them at once. That gaze held answers to questions never asked, never wanted.

As if they sliced pieces out of a Salvador Dali poster. Hah, it felt as surreal as the time my cat walked backward out of a doorway. And then there’s me, fingers attempting to snatch moments from the air, committing them to cursory text. Strange thing though, aren't they? 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮𝘴 like this one—they make a paradox of clarity where chaos threads through impeccably.

Hope I'm remembering to return that book I borrowed—it’s somewhere in this mindfold, akin to this jumbled blurry spectacle Borderline spat into my cortex. Nod off? nah...just...enthralled, is that it?
